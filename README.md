**CLI tool for installing static configuration or dotfiles.**

## Description

- ü¶â **Idempotent:** syncs directories, copies files,
  creates system links, deletes paths, and sets access permissions to ensure
  the system will be in a consistent state after each run.
- üê¨ **Declarative**: all operations are defined
  in a manifest file with a simple syntax.
- üêç **Flexible**: operations may be limited only to specific hosts
  or only when specific packages are installed,
  additionally, since the manifest is written in JavaScript,
  it may include arbitrary logic.
- üêπ **Minimal:** written in &lt; 500 lines of code
  using only the Node.js standard library and a few system calls.
- üê° **Secure:** no additional third party dependencies (except `rsync`):
  safe to run with `sudo` to install system files.
- ü¶Ö **Fast:** uses maximal concurrency
  and allows custom ordering of groups of operations.


#### Try it out

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm test`:
   This will install the configuration
   defined in `test/manifest.js` to `test/dest`.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS with [rsync] installed.
- [Node.js] version 8 or above.
- For conditional configuration based on installed packages,
  the following package managers are supported:
  [Pacman], [Homebrew], [dpkg], or [pkgng].

[dpkg]: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/dpkg.html
[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/
[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[Pacman]: https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/
[pkgng]: https://wiki.freebsd.org/pkgng
[rsync]: https://rsync.samba.org/

## Installation

1. Add this as a development dependency to your project using [npm] with

    ```
    $ npm install --save-dev @rxrc/curator
    ```

2. Add a [script][npm scripts] to your `package.json` with `"curator": "curator"`
   so you may run this with

    ```
    $ npm run curator
    ```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[npm scripts]: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts

## Usage

Create a `manifest.js` file to define the configuration
and run the `curator` command to install the configuration.

- The manifest configuration is defined below.
  Copy the example manifest from [`manifest.example.js`](./manifest.example.js).
- The location of the manifest file may be passed as the first argument,
  otherwise it looks for `manifest.js` in the current working directory.
- The environment variables `CURATOR_IO` and `CURATOR_PKG` may be set
  to override the `ioType` and `pkgType` values from the manifest.

### Manifest

#### Minimal example

```js
/* manifest.js */

'use strict'

const os = require('os')

const targetRoot = os.homedir()

const unlinks = [{
  src: 'old.conf'
}]

const directories = [{
  src: '.config/envs'
}, {
  src: 'vim',
  dst: '.vim'
}, {
  src: 'private',
  dmode: '0700',
  fmode: '0600',
  user: 'root',
  group: 'wheel'
}]

const files = [{
  src: '.zshrc'
}, {
  src: `keys/${os.hostname()}`,
  dst: '.ssh/id_rsa',
  fmode: '0600',
  pkgs: ['openssh']
}]

const symlinks = [{
  src: '.config/env.conf',
  dst: '.config/envs.${os.hostname()}.conf',
  hosts: ['alpha', 'delta']
}]

module.exports = {targetRoot, unlinks, directories, files, symlinks}
```

#### Complete manifest API

```js
/* manifest.js */

'use strict'

/* Prefix for all source paths
 * except for unlinks and symlinks which use targetRoot below.
 *
 * Use __dirname to refer to the location of this file
 * and process.cwd() for the current working directory.
 *
 * Default: the current working directory.
 */
const originRoot = require('os').homedir()

/* Prefix for all destination paths.
 * For unlinks and symlinks, the source is also prefixed.
 *
 * Use __dirname to refer to the location of this file
 * and process.cwd() for the current working directory.
 *
 * Default: a ./dest folder under the current working directory.
 */
const targetRoot = require('os').homedir()

/* Package lookup backend to use:
 * pacman, dpkg, homebrew, pkgng, or noop.
 *
 * The special value noop will assume all packages are installed.
 *
 * Default: attempt to autodetect, fallback to noop.
 */
const pkgType = 'homebrew'

/* I/O backend to use:
 * linux, macos, or noop.
 *
 * The special value noop will not perform any modifications
 * and only log what actions would be taken.
 *
 * Default: attempt to autodetect, fallback to noop.
 */
const ioType = 'macos'

/* Defaults to use for each operation.
 *
 * Default: shown below.
 */
const defaults = {
  order: 100, // all operations start with this order value
  dmode: '0750', // files have user write, group read, other no access
  fmode: '0640', // directories have user write, group read, other no access
  user: process.getuid(), // current user
  group: process.getgid() // current group
}

/* Operations to perform by type.
 *
 * Operations always happen in this order: unlinks, directories, files, and symlinks.
 *
 * Each type of operations waits until the previous type has completed successfully.
 *
 * Operations of each type with equal order value are always done in parallel,
 * but operations with a later order do not start until earlier ones complete.
 *
 * Specifying an array of hostnames will restrict that
 * operation to matching hosts (case insensitive).
 *
 * Specifying an array of packages will restrict that
 * operation to hosts with all packages installed (case insensitive).
 *
 * All operation types will default to an empty array if unset.
 */

/* Unlink (unconditionally remove) the directory, file, or symlink at src.
 *
 * The src is relative to the global targetRoot option.
